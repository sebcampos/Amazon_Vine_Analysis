# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
 
## Overview of Analysis
 
The purpose of our analysis was to determine whether or not there was positivity bias in relation to 5 star ratings between paid vine reviews and non paid vine reviews. To do so we created a set of paid for vine reviews and non paid for vine reviews, then took the 5 star average of each one respectively the resulting percentages reflected below

## Results
- Total number of Vine reviews (PAID):
  
   107
  
   includes 56 five star reviews
  
   (%52 five star)
 
- Total number of Vine reviews (UNPAID):
  
   39869
  
   includes 21005 five star reviews
  
   (%52 five star)
 
 
 
## Summary
 
There is no notable positivity bias when looking at the above figures, as we can see paid for reviews and non paid for reviews yield the same percentage of 5 star ratings. A recommendation would be to run this analysis on other vine related datasets to see if this lack of positivity bias is consistent or only related to this particular dataset.
